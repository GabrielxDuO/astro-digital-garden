## Ideas

- sidebar: show "new" (or "fresh") badge based on git update time?
- Footnotes
  - mention how footnotes can be shown on the side, like in [Tufte design](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)

## Color for tag

I can easily generate color from tag:

```js
import ch from "color-hash";
const colorHash = new ch.default();
colorHash.hex(tag);
```

I can use it in:

- [x] color-chip near the tag or maybe color underline?
- [x] Euler diagram
- [x] content graph
- [ ] social images - to generate colorful "border"

I implemented prototype in branch [tag-color](https://github.com/stereobooster/astro-digital-garden/tree/tag-color)
