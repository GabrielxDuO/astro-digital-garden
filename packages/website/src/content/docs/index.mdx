## About Digital Gardens

[Digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), also known as a [Second brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/), [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), personal wiki, or personal knowledge management.

There are different aspects of a digital garden. It can be seen as a way to take notes just for yourself, but for me, it's more interesting as a way to organize knowledge and publish it as a (static) website.

There are various editors (note-taking applications) such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), and [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) to name a few. But again, I am more interested in the publishing aspectâ€”assuming you have already created content with an editor of your choice.

My previous articles on the subject:

- [Digital Garden as Static Website](https://stereobooster.com/posts/digital-garden-as-static-website/)
- [Useful Modern Tools for Static Websites](https://stereobooster.com/posts/useful-modern-tools-for-static-websites/)
- [What I Miss in Markdown (and Hugo)](https://stereobooster.com/posts/what-i-miss-in-markdown/)

## Goal

The **ultimate goal** is to create a theme and set of tools to publish a digital garden with the help of Astro. For now, I am collecting relevant code snippets and links.

## Notation

Symbols used in the sidebar:

- ðŸ§  - Just an idea. There is no solution or specific action.
- ðŸš· - I know what I want to do, but I don't know how exactly.
- ðŸš§ - I know what I want to do, and I know how to do it. What is left is to actually implement it.
