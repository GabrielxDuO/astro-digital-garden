:::tip
Please note that this graph is generated on the server side as SVG.

- **Pros**: It doesn't require a large JS library to run visualization on the client.
- **Cons**: It doesn't look as fancy as graphs generated on the client side and lacks interactivity.
:::

import GraphPage from "@components/GraphPage.astro";

<GraphPage />

**Features**:

- Nodes are HTML links.
- Labels are shown when nodes are hovered over (requires JS to work).
- Pan/Zoom works thanks to [[svg-pan-zoom]].
