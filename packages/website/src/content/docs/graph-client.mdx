This page is a work in progress.

This is an example of client-side generation of a content graph (in contrast to [[graph|server-side generated graph]]).

For now, it uses Sigma.js; alternatively, you can use:

- [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html#chart-type-graph)
- [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- [D3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force)
- or [others](https://graph.stereobooster.com/notes/Visualisation/)

**Todo**:

- [ ] Links for nodes
- [ ] Zoom behavior is a bit annoying; is there a way to customize it?
- [ ] Tags probably should have a constant size or damping factor; otherwise, they will always be the biggest nodes.
- [ ] On node hover, highlight neighbor nodes and connecting edges.
- [ ] If there were metadata for tags or pages, like color or icon, it could be used for graph visualization.
