**Problem**: Links in Starlight (and [[sidebar|autogenerated sidebar]]) are connected to the file path. However, in digital gardens, content often gets moved around, resulting in broken links.

## Brainstorming

### Redirects

Every time a page is moved, add the previous version to the [redirects](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#redirects) section.

It would be even better if these [redirects could be specified in the frontmatter](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/1847), similar to how itâ€™s done in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases).

### Bare slugs

For example, if the path is `some/thing/a.md`, generate the URL as `/a` instead of `some/thing/a`. This allows you to move the file to `other/a.md` without changing the URL.

Paths can be used for:

- [Breadcrumbs](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/breadcrumbs)
- [Sidebar](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/)

#### Hack for Starlight

This behavior can be achieved in Starlight by putting `slug` in the frontmatter:

```md
// src/content/docs/recipes/alphabetical-index.mdx
---
slug: alphabetical-index
---
```

### Permanent Anchors

Anchors can also break, though this issue is likely less significant compared to broken links.

One approach is to [specify an ID instead of using a slug](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids). This allows you to change the heading text without altering the ID:

```md
### My Great Heading {#custom-id}
```
### Conflicting Pages

In addition to content pages, there will be some special pages, such as:

- `/recent`
  - `/recent/[page]`
- `/graph`
- `/alphabetical`
- `/tags`
  - `/tags/[name]`
- `/search`
- etc.

In these cases, built-in pages should take priority over content pages, which may require renaming some content pages. However, for `/tags/[name]`, both content and built-in pages can be displayed, similar to how it's handled in Hugo.
