Starlight provides sidebar, but it has issues:

- it doesn't preserve state (scroll, open/closed submenues) on page switch
- not possible to have root page for submenues

There are workarounds:

- [starlight#971](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/971#discussioncomment-8396511)
- [starlight#307](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/307#issuecomment-1622619025)

## Further improvements

Starlight provides configurable sidebar, which is good enough for documentation. For digital garden we may want to use different approach, for example:

- file system tree (possible with built-in sidebar)
- [[tag-list|tag list or articles grouped by tags]]
- [[recently-changed-pages|articles grouped by date]]
- [[alphabetical-index|alphabetical list]]

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
