**Problem**: Links in Starlight (and [[sidebar|autogenerated sidebar]]) connected to the path of file. But in case of digital gardens one often moves content around, which results in broken links.

## Brainstorming

### Redirtects

Every time page moved - add previous version to [redirects](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#redirects) section.

Would be even better if those [redircets could be specified in frontmatter](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/issues/466#issuecomment-1638583673), like in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases).

### Bare slugs

For example, if path is `some/thing/a.md` generate URL like this `/a`, instead of `some/thing/a`. This allows to move file to `other/a.md` without changing URL. We can either:

- use filename as slug (instead of path)
  - it can be hard to keep names unique
- or specify slug in frontmatter
  - may feel like double work

### Permanent anchors

Anchors also can brake, this is probably less of a problem compared to broken links.

One way is to [specify id instead of using slugger](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids), which would allow to change text without changing id:

```md
### My Great Heading {#custom-id}
```

### Conflicting pages

Except content pages, there will be some special pages, like:

- `/recent`
  - `/recent/[page]`
- `/graph`
- `/alphabetical`
- `/tags`
  - `/tags/[name]`
- `/search`
- etc.
