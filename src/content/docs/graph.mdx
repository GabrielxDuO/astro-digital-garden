:::tip
Pay attention that this graph is generated on the server side as SVG.

- **Pros**: it doesn't require big JS library to run vizualization on the client
- **Cons**: it looks not as fancy as grphs generated on the client side and lacks interactivity

:::

import GraphPage from "@components/GraphPage.astro";

<GraphPage />

**Features**:

- Nodes are HTML links
- Labels are shown when nodes are hovered (requires JS to work)
- Pan/Zoom works thanks to [[svg-pan-zoom]]
