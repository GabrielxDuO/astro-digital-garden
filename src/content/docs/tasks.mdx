import MaterialSymbolsLink from "~icons/material-symbols/link";

- [ ] write an article about task extraction
  - fix bug: `task.text()` doesn't work if it contains wikilink (`[[something]]`)
- [ ] implement [[faceted-search]]
- [ ] add [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/)
  - see [starlight#694](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/pull/694#issuecomment-2021611520)
- [ ] implement [[social-images-autogenration]]
- [ ] implement better user action tracking (beyond page navigations)
  - if search was used
  - if external links were clicked
  - if page preview was shown
- [ ] write about dark mode for [[mermaid-diagrams-in-markdown]]
- [ ] write an article about footnotes
  - mention how footnotes can be shown on the side, like in [Tufte design](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)
  - https://gwern.net/sidenote
- Crazy idea: write transpiler from Mermaid to Graphviz. At least `flowchart` should be possible to convert
  - There is [flow.jison](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/3809732e48a0822fad596d0815a6dc0e166dda94/packages/mermaid/src/diagrams/flowchart/parser/flow.jison)
- It should be possible to assign metdata for each page and/or tag. For example, it can be color or icon. Then this metadata can be reused:
  - color and icon for nodes in [[content-graph-visualization]]
  - icons can be shown for tags (like this: #link <MaterialSymbolsLink class="icon text" />)
  - icons can be shown for pages in sidebar and near link to them
  - page may have "stage" (idea, draft, in progress, or finished). Right now I use emojis:  ðŸ§ , ðŸš·, ðŸš§. Similar idea: [Taxonomy of note types](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/taxonomy-of-note-types/),
