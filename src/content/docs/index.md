[Digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) aka [Second brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/), [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), personal wiki, personal knowledge management.

There are different aspects of a digital garden. It can be seen as a way to take notes just for yourself, but for me, it's more interesting as a way to organize knowledge and publish it as a (static) website.

There are different editors (note-taking applications): [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) to name few. But again, I am more interested in the publishing part - assuming you already created content with an editor of your choice.
