This page is work in progress

This is an example of client side generation of content graph (in contras to [[graph|server side generated graph]]).

For now it use Sigma.js alternatively can use:

- [cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force)
- or [others](https://graph.stereobooster.com/notes/Visualisation/)

**Todo**:

- [ ] links for nodes
- [ ] zoom behaviour is a bit anoying, is there a way to customize it?
- [ ] tags probably should have constant size or damping factor, otherwise they always would be biggest nodes
- [ ] on node hover - highlight neigbour nodes and connecting edges
- [ ] if there would be meta data for tags or pages, like color or icon - it can be used for graph vizualization
